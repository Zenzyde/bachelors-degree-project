# bachelors-degree-project
A modified version of the dungeon generation algorithm in the game TinyKeep by Phi Dinh. Made as a bachelor's degree project based on the idea of converting a structural dungeon generation algorithm from a 2D space to a 3D space, thus enabling the Y-value of an individual rooms position to vary between all rooms in a dungeon.

Visual example of a dungeon generated by the algorithm:
![Dungeon generation example](/images/Pilottest_Dungeon_3.png)
* Yellow blocks mark corridors
* Green blocks mark stairs and are in groups of four
* Purple rooms mark rooms that were excluded for size-restrictions before getting included in the corridor building stage
* The orange room marks the goal room
* The cyan room marks the starting room

This project makes use of a few algorithms and AI to accomplish this result: Delaunay Triangulation (incremental Bowyer-Watson), A* Pathfinding, Prims MST algorithm and steering behaviours

A dungeon gets generated during runtime and is controlled by the following script:
