# bachelors-degree-project
A modified version of the dungeon generation algorithm in the game TinyKeep by Phi Dinh. Made as a bachelor's degree project based on the idea of converting a structural dungeon generation algorithm from a 2D space to a 3D space, thus enabling the Y-value of an individual rooms position to vary between all rooms in a dungeon.
